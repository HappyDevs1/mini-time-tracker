[https://public/screenshot.png](https://github.com/HappyDevs1/mini-time-tracker/blob/main/Screenshot%20(286).png)

## Overview
The Mini Time Tracker is a web application that helps users track their time spent on various tasks. Users can create time entries with task names and hours worked, view all entries, see total hours worked, and use an active timer to track time in real-time.

## Features
- Create time entries with task names and hours worked
- View all time entries in a list
- See total hours worked across all entries
- Edit or delete existing entries
- Start/stop timer for real-time tracking
- Local storage persistence
- Responsive design

## Setup and Run Instructions
### Prerequisites
1. Node.js (v16 or higher)
2. npm (v8 or higher)

### Installation
**Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HappyDevs1/mini-time-tracker.git
cd mini-time-tracker
```
**Install dependencies:**
```bash
npm install
```
**Start the development server:**
```bash
npm start
```
**Open the app in your browser:**

```text
http://localhost:5173
```
**Building for Production**
```bash
npm run build
```
**Deployment**
Install Vercel CLI:
```bash
npm install -g vercel
```
**Deploy to Vercel:**
```bash
vercel
```

## Assumptions and Trade-offs
### Assumptions
1. Users only need to track time on a single device (no cloud sync)
2. Timer accuracy within 1 second is sufficient
3. Users are comfortable with English interface
4. Task names don't require categorization or tagging
5. Time entries don't need date information

### Trade-offs
1. Local Storage vs Database:
2. Used localStorage for simplicity and offline support
3. Trade-off: Data not synced across devices
   Timer Implementation:
   Used JavaScript intervals for timer updates
6. Trade-off: Potential drift over long periods
   UI Framework:
   Used Tailwind CSS for rapid styling
8. Trade-off: Larger CSS bundle size
   State Management:
   Used React useState for simplicity
9. Trade-off: Might become complex with more features
Form Validation:
Basic client-side validation only
Trade-off: No server-side validation

## What I'd Improve with More Time
### Core Improvements
1. User Authentication:
  Add login system with JWT tokens
  Support multiple users with separate data
2. Backend Integration:
  Create Node.js/Express API
  Use MongoDB/PostgreSQL for data storage
  Implement proper data synchronization
3. Enhanced Timer:
  Web Workers for more accurate timing
  Background timer persistence
  Pause/resume functionality
4. Reporting Features:
  Daily/weekly/monthly summaries
  Charts and visualizations (using Chart.js)
  Export to CSV/PDF functionality
